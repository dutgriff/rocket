# rocket
This is a VueJS version of the previous Rocket project I built with PHP and jQuery. The old version does work but has jumbled complex logic making it difficult to analyse the code. This complex logic was copied from pages of calculations and was never meant to be understood. With this version I aim to break down the complexity to allow calculation reviews.

This project was built based on an old BASIC rocket prediction program written by a college professor to calculate predictions 
of model rocket flight for a course project. For the college's purposes all calculations are correct. I am not sure that the college uses multiple stages or even multiple engines per stage for the Performance Predictions so I can't confirm that this has been tested and works correctly.

If you have knowledge of model rockets or physics and can analyse the calculations, please let me know if you find anything wrong.

If you would like to expand this project in any way and need a developer to do so, let me know. I'm always up for a challenge.
